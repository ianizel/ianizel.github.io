            <h2> What is Music? </h2>
            <p>
                According to Google, music is "an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture." But it's more than just a bunch of sounds put together to create a song, it's life. If you really think about it, we hear music almost everywhere we go. Like, for example, at a restaurant or a store. Even if you don't leave your house, you might still be listening to music through your phone, computer, or something else.
