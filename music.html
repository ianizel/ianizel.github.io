            <h2> What is Music? </h2>
            <p>
                According to Google, music is "an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture." But it's more than just a bunch of sounds put together to create a song, it's life. If you really think about it, we hear music almost everywhere we go. Like, for example, at a restaurant or a store. Even if you don't leave your house, you might still be listening to music through your phone, computer, or something else.

            <h2> How long has Music been Around? </h2>
            <p>
                Nobody really knows the exact date that music started, but scientists have predicted that music started sometime around 4000 BCE. That's about 6 millenniums that music has existed! Obviously, music has evolved and changed a lot in different ways since it was first created, so now there's a huge variety of genres and types of music. Music has always been traveling around the world, and people are always adapting it and changing it to their likings. But enough about the facts, this page is about me and my experiences with music!

            <h2> How It Started </h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was brought home, music has always been a part of my life (probably because my dad is a musician). But even when he's not home, my mom loves to play her favorite songs, so I get to listen to that. Up to this day, it's basically the same thing, although some things have changed. I now play a couple of instruments, because my dad pays for private lessons, and I also like to listen to <em> my</em> favorite music while working.

            <h2> Instruments that I have Played </h2>
            <p>
                Here are all the instruments that I have played in my life (in no particular order):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Ukulele </li>
                <li> Clarinet </li>
                <li> Violin </li>
                <li> Piano </li>
                <li> Drums </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, here are the instruments that I currently play:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Clarinet </li>
                <li> Violin </li>
                <li> Piano </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I still play these 3 instruments because these are the 3 that my dad pays for private lessons. The others are instruments that I have played because my dad knows how play them and taught us. He usually taught us these during summer, when we didn't have school work to worry about. However, whenever school starts, our work starts piling up, and so does our dad's, and we have no time to practice.

            <h2> Benefits of Music </h2>
            <p>
                Like I mentioned in the "My Family" section in the homepage, my dad is constantly traveling. Sometimes, he takes us with him, so we accompany him to the events (usually they are parties or cultural events). That's one of the many benefits of music, being able to travel to a bunch of cool places. Also, because I can play instruments, I get invited to play at different events. However, they're somewhat small events, usually just relating to family. It's not like I get asked to play gigs just like my dad. For example, a couple of weeks ago, my godfather invited me to play in a high school band (the one his oldest son is in), so I accepted, and I practiced the songs that we would play.
