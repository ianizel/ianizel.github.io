            <p>
                This is what you will learn (or at least what I learned, it might differ based on teachers and what year that you're in the class) while in the ATM program.

            <h2> ATM Reflection </h2>
            <p>
                The ATM program is really amazing and it’s extremely helpful to students who are just barely being introduced to a relatively new computer and technology. It’s been especially helpful to me because I’ve been able to discover new programs and methods of doing things that I’ve never been able to do before. I truly believe that because of this ATM program, my future, such as high school or working in a job, will be a lot easier than it has ever been before. I think that anyone who enjoys using technology will just love ATM!
