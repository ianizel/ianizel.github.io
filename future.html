            <h2> High School </h2>
            <p>
                Since high school is coming up pretty quickly and also is extremely important, I did a lot of research to make sure I get into a good school. I have considered a lot of high schools, but in the end I decided to put Millikan MIT, as my first choice, and QUEST, as my second choice. If I don't get into those, I am considering Poly PACE as my third choice. <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/200811427/build-your-own-business-website" target="_blank"> Here are some other high schools that I have considered. </a>

            <h2> College </h2>
            <p>
                I'm not entirely sure about which college to attend, but there are some colleges that are based around technology, such as Caltech (California Institute of Technology) and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) which appeal to me because of my love for technology.

            <h2> Some of my Career Interests </h2>
            <p>
                These are some of the careers that appeal to me and seem interesting to me because of my interests in technology, games, and videos:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Game Designer </li>
                <li> Filmer </li>
                <li> Special Effects Artist </li>
                <li> Audio Editor </li>
                <li> Multimedia Artist and Animator </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In 6th grade, in my ATM class, we were assigned a project to choose a career, look into it, and write a small essay about it. This was when I didn't consider filming or editing as a job, so that's why Multimedia Artist and Animator is in the list shown above. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUWbRM5CoUN6IDdGR1QJ97u8dvS64OQYrpV_1knFCJQ/edit" target="_blank"> Here is the link to the essay that I had to write. </a>

            <h2> My Goals for the Future </h2>
            <p>
                To graduate high school with a high GPA, get a job that I love doing, have a popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/djdiegoizel" target="_blank"> YouTube page</a>, and maybe visit Mexico.
