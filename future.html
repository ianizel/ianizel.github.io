            <p>
                Since high school is coming up pretty quickly and also is extremely important, I did a lot of research to make sure I get into a good school.

If I don't get into those, I am considering Poly PACE as my third choice. <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/200811427/build-your-own-business-website" target="_blank"> Here are some other high schools that I have considered.</a>

            <h2> College </h2>
            <p>
                I am not entirely sure about which college to attend, but there are some colleges that are based around technology, such as Caltech (California Institute of Technology) and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) which appeal to me because of my love for technology.
