            <h2> My Family </h2>
            <p>
                My mom and dad were both born in Mexico, and they traveled to America where they met. They married in 2004, and then they had me. The next year, 2005, they had my little brother. My dad is a <a href="http://rorodriguez.com/mariachi_romanza_info" target="_blank"> musician</a>, so he's constantly traveling all over the place. He has an immense mariachi band, and he can play a huge variety of instruments. He has also paid for music lessons so that we, his kids, can learn how to play different instruments. Right now, we play the clarinet, violin, and piano.

            <h2> Skills that I have </h2>
            <p>
                I have a lot of skills because of the <a href="https://lbbancroft.schoolloop.com/atm" target="_blank"> ATM</a> program that I am really proud of, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Typing Rapidly </li>
                <li> Microsoft Apps </li>
                <li> Google Apps </li>
                <li> Photoshop </li>
                <li> Illustrator </li>
                <li> InDesign </li>
                <li> SketchUp </li>
                <li> Coding </li>
                <li> Filming </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I also have another set of skills that aren't ATM-related, including:

            <h2> My Hobbies </h2>
            <p>
                Whenever I have free time, you'll probably find me playing games on my computer. I love playing different types of video games, but whenever I feel like taking a break, I'll probably eat a snack or watch some videos on YouTube. If I'm watching videos, I'll most likely be watching Ryan Higa (his username is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nigahiga" target="_blank"> nigahiga</a>) since he is my favorite YouTuber. I also enjoy watching Netflix, whether it's a show or a movie. My favorite genres are comedy, action, and horror.

            <h2> Things I'm Interested In </h2>
            <p>
                Overall, I'm really interested in technology. I really like video production, from using the camera to film to recording sounds with microphones. I also enjoy post-production, such as adding in visual or sound effects. To add on, I really cherish any forms of social media, (obviously, since I'm a teen) because it allows me to virtually interact with my friends, and see how things are going with them.

            <h2> Awards that I have Received </h2>
            <p>
                In 6th and 7th grade, I have received the Principal’s Honor Roll, meaning that I’ve had a 4.0 GPA for both years. If I work hard enough, I should definitely be able to earn it again this year. I’ve also achieved the All Es Citizenship award, and some other awards that I have received are Perfect Attendance awards in elementary and middle school, meaning that I have not missed a day of school, or arrived late at a class.
